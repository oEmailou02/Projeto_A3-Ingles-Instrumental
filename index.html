            <h2>What is digital security?</h2>
            <p>
                Digital security can be understood as the preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of authenticity of documents and personal data, in the virtual environment. <br>
                It includes processes and tools that help scale this protection and covers computers, networks, data or programs. <br>
                The three pillars of digital security are:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Confidentiality;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrity;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Availability;
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>
                Confidentiality is understood as the way in which companies treat the privacy of data or information, in this context. <br>
                Establishes rules and good practices to ensure that the most sensitive and confidential information is properly preserved. In other words,
                The aim is to ensure that none of these sources are subject to misuse or loss.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Integrity</h2>
            <p>
                The more accurate, consistent and reliable the data, the better. The same applies to the systems that store and/or process this data. <br>
                Both the originality and the source must be maintained and protected without any interference or manipulation.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Availability</h2>
            <p>
                Thinking about how to make this data available is an important part of the digital security process. This is because, respecting the previous points, not all data should be made publicly available. <br>
                Additionally, you may need to create permission levels for access to fonts.
                The objective is to limit access to only those who really need it. <br>
                Data governance and information security are very valid and indispensable concerns for any company - regardless of whether it is in the financial sector, healthcare or retail, for example - which are segments where high information turnover is very common.

            <h2>Differences between digital security, cybersecurity and information security</h2>
            <p>
                As you enter this increasingly technological and dynamic environment, you will certainly hear many terms. Although they are related, it is worth understanding what they mean in practice. <br>
                In the case of digital security, we are talking about the entire ecosystem - from tools to processes -,
                with cybersecurity and information security being two of these preventive actions. <br>
                The effective protection of systems, networks, programs and digital infrastructure against attacks is done through cybersecurity. <br>
                The professional who wants to work in this area must have more technical knowledge and implement security routines to avoid any type of invasion.

                Information security is the set of measures used to keep what is most important and valuable to companies confidential. But not only that, it also develops strategies and policies to ensure the integrity and availability of information.
